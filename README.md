# My-Jarvis
# Jarvis - Desktop AI Assistant  🤖 A "Jarvis-style" AI voice assistant for Windows, built with Python, the OpenAI API, and the `speech_recognition` library.  This script actively listens for voice commands, processes them, and responds with spoken audio. It can hold a conversation, open websites, launch local applications, and tell you the time.
